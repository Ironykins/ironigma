# Ironigma

An AngularJS-based Enigma Machine Emulator.
Currently a work-in-progress

You can find a demo of the app here: [Ironigma Enigma Machine Emulator](http://austhaus.com/ironigma).

The initial version will emulate a 3-rotor M3 Enigma. I may add the ability to emulate other machines at a later date.

(Built using [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/))
Uses QUnit for Unit Testing
Uses some components of Bootstrap.
